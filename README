Notes:

A symbolic link “data” should be created pointing to the folder that stores dependencies (.txt and .csv files). 


Description:

Sample count in SNP file: 20087
Sample count in phenotype file: 20723
Intersection: 19534

17699 samples have oil production in phenotype record, and 124 amoung them are not in SNP file. Therefore, number of samples that are put into xgboost is 17575.


Files:

plot.py: to plot distribution of individual trait;

preprocessing.py: to correlate SNP file and phenotype file, and save intermediate results  (because this process can be very time-consuming);

xgboost.py (to be added): to use extracted SNP information (above intermediate results) to predict oil production, and report cross-validation accuracy scores.
